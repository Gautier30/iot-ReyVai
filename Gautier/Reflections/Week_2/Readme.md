### Reflection Lecture

This lecture was interesting as we teamed up to research on the different buses used in IoT. Finding information ourselves was actually more stimulating than just reading a lecture slide. Plus, presenting it to the class with our own words ensures we first try to understand ourselves.

### Reflection Lab

This lab was quite straight forward. So far nothing new personnaly.
