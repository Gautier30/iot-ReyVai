### Reflection Lecture

Defining the terms associated with IoT like "edge computing", "fog computing" was a bit tricky, and borderline confusing, but eventually the several attempts at sketching the relationships and "hierarchies" of all the concepts made it clearer.

About the Pi gateway, I'm impressed we're given such equipement to use as "routers on steroids", knowing how hard they are to source in those days of electronics shortage.

### Reflection Lab

We wasted quite a lot of time debugging connectivity issues on the Pi gateway, so we had to stay late to finish the LED blink tasks.
Also, performing the tasks AND documenting everything on the portfolio was really time consuming...

A cool outcome of this lab is that I automated a lamp at home using the same HTTP requests we've learned, no more need to get out of bed to turn it off. I knew bringing my ESP32 and relays to Estonia would come in handy. :)
