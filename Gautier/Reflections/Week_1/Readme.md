### Reflection Lecture
I enjoyed this introduction to the class. The very relaxed atmosphere is promising and I feel like these learning conditions will make for a really motivating IoT introduction. I am eager to start working on the labs and projects, and hope the TAs will help clear any doubts.

### Reflection Lab

I don't mind pairing up with Oliver without knowing him too much, but the idea of teaming up with strangers for the final project stresses me a little bit due to bad past experiences. Hopefully the fun will remain and the work will be good.

Going through all the components was time consuming but it was fun to discover the many sensors and controllers we have at hand to build cool projects.
