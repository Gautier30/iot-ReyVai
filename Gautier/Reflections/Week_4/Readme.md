### Reflection Lecture

Interesting lecture, very useful knowledge about MQTT and other IoT protocols. I'll finally improve my DIY IoT lamp and upgrade it's webserver, HTTP request logic by MQTT messages. This will definitely make it more reliable...

The videos were a bit quick though, I think I'll need to watch the IoTEmpower commands video again to really grasp how much easier it is to implement as opposed to regular CLI.

### Reflection Lab

The simulator was doable with the Python script, however, we tried to actually build the hardware button and hardware temperature sensor and we struggled parsing the payload to read the temperature and actuate the relay.
