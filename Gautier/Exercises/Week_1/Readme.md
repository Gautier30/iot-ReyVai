### Who am I?
My name is Gautier, I am an engineering student from France. My major is Robotics and Computer Engineering.

I have some experience with C++ and Python. Since the beginning of my studies I have worked on several projects both for school and personal needs. From Arduino sketches that would control educational robotic arms, to full on computer vision scripts on Python, I can confidently say I am an avid tinkerer.

I have worked with various Arduino boards (UNO, Nano, Mega...) as well as ESP32 dev boards. The latter was useful for projects involving Bluetooth or Wifi!

I have also worked with Raspbery boards in the past (teleop turret project, Turtlebot...).

In France I have my own 3D printer which runs almost 24/7. I love to prototype things and iterate my designs a lot. 3D printing comes in handy when I need to make some enclosures, or gather several sensors within the same package. Wiring up an array of sensors to a breakboard is fun, but making it look nicer in its own enclosure is better!

I had a brief introduction to IoT at school, we worked a little bit with Sigfox at the time. I also experimented custom querries with my Google Assistant smart speaker thanks to IFTTT.

I am not a huge fan of long boring lectures, therefore I enjoy when lecturers try to push students to participate. I really like interactive learning. I do believe some "lecturing" is necessary at some point, but it definitely goes hand in hand with practical work.

I hope this class will allow me to deepen my current knowledge of IoT, and especially help me design my own solutions without the need of codeless services like IFTTT.

### What is IoT ? (Google search)

1. *Domains of application:* wearables, home automation, smart cities, energy systems, logistics.

2. *Common data protocols:* MQTT, HTTP (Rest APIs), Zigbee.

3. *Typical devices:* ESP32 Âµ-controller, smart speakers, smart thermostat, smart fridges.

From this Bosch ad, I can add the automotive domain to my list of common IoT applications. Smart Home appliances and autonomous cars are shown in this commercial.

### TIA IoT

Two more IoT **domains** are agriculture and healthcare.

Some **benefits** of IoT are that it allows to connect devices together, which is a high value proposition, while those devices on their own would not be of a huge interest. IoT provides monitoring and remote control of assets and resources which ultimately make the users' lives easier.

Some **challenges** of IoT are mainly the vulnerability of the systems and the growing power consumption of modern network protocols, which implies batteries need to be improved.
