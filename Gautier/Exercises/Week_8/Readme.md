## Grafana presentation

### Introduction to Grafana

*Primary components:*

* Dashboards

    Grafana dashboards can display plots of values.
    
* Data sources

    Data can come from different databases such as InfluxDB or Prometheus.

* Alerts and notifications
    
    Alerts are useful to notify on different mediums (e-mails, sms, Discord...) about different events such as temperature runout on a Rasberry Pi, network breach...


**TO DO: Search about docker containers.**

**Time series database:** A database which data is timestamped.

*Wrapping up: both Grafana and Node-RED should be used for different applications. Maybe Node-RED is easier at a prototyping stage, but then, when the time comes to present results or deploy a solution to the public, Grafana seems more appropriate.*
