# Telia Guest Lecture

### **What are the driving forces behind IoT development? Is this all hype?**

Estonia is shutting down 3G but 2G is still in use as a backup channel in IoT.

Industry 4.0 can benefit from 5G.

5G improves latency which enables reliable autonomous vehicles.

## Network Technologies

**NB-IoT** (Narrow Band) is greatly used mainly because it draws less power and modules are cost effective. But it lacks in data speeds and latency is not good.

**LTE-M** is an imrovement of NB-IoT with a trade-off on battery life.

**4G/LTE** is super powerfull and supports roaming but the battery usage is super high.

**5G** is a huge bump in latency and data speeds from 4G but its power hungry and the devices are expensive.

## Telia's solutions

* ### M2M 

    Telia has the biggest share in the M2M market.

* ### Remote metering

    Metering is done remotely to avoid sending someone to read the water, electricity and disctrict heating consumption.

    Over 5 years Telia deployed 25,000 batter-powered ultrasonic flow sensor that send data over NB-IoT network.

    Less labor, smaller CO2 footprint.

    The water meters only send out data, there is no "handshake" with the server to notify back if the packets were received. The meters have some logic to test if the network is good. If so, the data is sent, otherwise they wait to avoid spamming the server although the packets are never received. **Power is saved avoiding failed data transfers.**

* ### SmartCity

    Telia provides the platform and the front-end for that platform.
    Data is aggregated for city officials > smarter decisions.

    Highlights:
        
    - Build energy class information
    - City sound levels
    - Recycling stations
    - Air quality stations
    - Public toilets, water taps

* ### Crowd Insights

    Collect data from smartphones to monitor crowd movements in the city, during events... Estimate number of visitors, count foreign or resident visitors... Helps optimizing tourism and campaigns for major events.


## What business is IoT?

Data valuation business:
- M2M
- IoT
- Data insights

It's a digitalization business.

## Sharing economy
More and more actors in the urban environment: **Bolt** carriers (scooters, bikes...), **Starship** delivery robots...

## ELMO: Remote controlled car

Solves the issue of transporting one car (requires 2 persons and 2 cars for the way back) or renting cars in two locations.

##  Aiomatic, Tehnopol ja MÖMesi: Smart beehive

Monitor beehives:
- Internal temperature
- Relative humidity
- CO2/VOC levels
- Ambient light, sound and air pressure

## Krakul OÜ - Smart shoe sole (gait analysis)

"Without data you are just another person with an opinion"

*Is it so? Why and why not?*
