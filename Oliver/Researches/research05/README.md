How can we develop and manage software faster for IoT?
We can use IoT integration frameworks


● What are the key challenges of IoT and why?
-
- it is "ever-growing", the number of devices increases exponentially
- IoT platforms have to work with eachother
- half of the cost is for integration
- connectivity
- not connected
- latency
- not reliable/ cost effective
- no unified standard
-----
- 

● What is/are the generic solution(s) for it?
-
- IoT standards
- HIP hybrid integration platform ***
- Fog Computation - keeps data at the edge, adding computation to gateways and devices
- dataflow pipeline 

● Two examples for used patterns.
-
- enterprise integration patterns


● What are the different categories of the presented
frameworks?
-
- Dataflow pipeline
- Stream processing
- Process engine
● What are the main features of each category?
-
Flows:
- 

Streams:
- editing/understanding while data is in motion
- making correlations
- machine learning
Process Engine:
- Logic at the edge
- wiring together hardware
● Three or more examples of applications.
-
For flows:
- nifi
- stremsets
- cask hydrator
- penthalo
- informatica
- talend

Stream processing
- microsoft

Process Engine:
- kura
- Node-Red
- Flogo

● Three or more examples of available tools.
