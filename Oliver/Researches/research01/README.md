## Who am I?

My name is Oliver Vainikko, and I'm a bachelor's student at the University of Tartu.

## What type of programming experience do I have?

With a strong passion for creating and a drive to expand my skill set, I started my journey with programming four years ago by teaching myself Python through various YouTube tutorials. I have honed my skills and have three years of experience with Java. I had the opportunity to further develop my abilities through an internship at Playtech, where I gained invaluable hands-on experience in the industry. Throughout my academic career, I have programmed in many different languages. I have also actively participated in numerous school projects, constantly striving to challenge myself and expand my knowledge in the field of computer programming.

## What have I done with microcontrollers? Which ones have I used?

I have extensive experience working with microcontrollers, specifically the ESP32 and ESP8266 boards. My first experience with microcontrollers was six years ago when I used an ESP32 to create a WiFi jammer. I followed an online tutorial, and the code was readily available, making it an exciting and inexpensive project. Since then, I have found microcontrollers to be a fascinating area of technology, and I am currently pursuing a thesis on IoT micropayments using the ESP8266 and the XRP ledger. My passion for exploring the capabilities of microcontrollers continues to drive my interest, and I look forward to further expanding my knowledge in this field.

## Which single board computers do you know/have you used (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Beaglebone, Labrador)?

My experience with single-board computers has been limited to the Raspberry Pi, which I used for a school project where I created a small traffic light system.

## Who is a maker or part of a maker community knows, i.e. 3d printing?

Although I do not have direct experience with 3D printing, I have a strong background in hands-on creation and tinkering with various materials and electronics. I am a creative individual who enjoys working with what is available to me, whether items purchased from Aliexpress or materials found in the garage. My passion for making and fixing things has been a defining characteristic of who I am, and I believe it makes me a valuable addition to any "maker community".

## What do you already know about IoT?

IoT makes everyday objects more connected using y. IoT can be simple, and it can be really complex. I don't have a really clear understanding of how much stuff can be called IoT.

## What role do lectures play for you in university? Who likes them and thinks they are necessary? Who hates them and would like to reduce them? Who didnâ€™t think there was a choice?

My view on university lectures is that they can be both beneficial and challenging. It largely depends on factors such as the lecturer's delivery style and my level of interest in the subject. Some lectures can be engaging and informative, while others can be monotonous and tedious, often resulting in an info dump of information that makes it hard to make connections between the material and see how it all ties together. I appreciate lecturers who can keep my attention focused and bring the subject to life. Overall, lecturers have a valuable role in university education. Still, the effectiveness of each lecture varies greatly, and lecturers need to find ways to engage students and help them see the big picture.
 
## What are your expectations from this class?

Firstly, I want to ensure that the IoT aspect of my thesis is well-researched and thoroughly understood. This is a crucial aspect of my thesis, and I am confident Ulno and others have the expertise to guide me. Secondly, I am excited to tinker with some cool projects related to IoT. From my interactions with other students in this class, I have seen that they have a lot of experience and have already completed many projects. Being part of this class will provide me with opportunities to learn and grow. I am eager to absorb as much information as possible to achieve my academic goals while also pursuing my personal interests.
