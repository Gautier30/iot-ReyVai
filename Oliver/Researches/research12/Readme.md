# IoBT - Internet of Broken Things
What did already break (is broken)?
What will break?
Why?

- Mirai botnet attack
- Stuxnet malware
- Nest Thermostat malfunctions
- Samsung Smart TV issues
- Jeep Cherokee hack
- Baby monitor hacks
- Smart lock vulnerabilities
- Fitness tracker data leaks
- Smart home hub hacks
- Industrial IoT system breaches

The video discusses the vulnerabilities of IoT devices connected to the same network. Updates are difficult, and default passwords are often used, making it easy for hackers to access devices. Compromised devices can pose a threat to the entire network. Wired networks are more secure, and security should be incorporated into device maintenance and life cycle management.


- Everything is connected to one node
- Updates are difficult
- Android phones are vulnerable due to this reason
- Whole system is at risk if one device is compromised
- Default passwords are used
- Zombie webcams and routers
- Compromised devices can be used to attack the network
- DOS attacks can de-auth devices
- Network is at risk if devices don't use updated wifi protocols
- Passwords are sent as clear text
- Firewalls, gateways, and layered architecture can improve security
- Wired networks are more secure
- Security should be incorporated into device maintenance and life cycle management
- Devices are too powerful


Common sevurity risks: 
- Lecture discusses several attacks on IoT devices, including Man in the Middle, KRACK attack, and Cyber abuse
- Man in the Middle attack involves a stolen certificate and is difficult to prevent on small IoT devices
- Most IoT devices, including smart switches and lights, are vulnerable to attacks
- Gateways are needed to secure IoT devices and prevent attacks


To add security to an IoTEmpire

- Whitelist devices to limit access to only authorized devices
- Use encryption and hidden networks to prevent unauthorized access
- Use the latest password protocols to improve security
- Use trusted elements such as ESP32 and store credentials securely
- Implement device self-destruct capabilities in case of compromise
- Limit device permissions to prevent unauthorized actions
- Use gateways to secure IoT devices and prevent attacks
- Implement security measures for de-authentication to prevent unauthorized access
- Use uncommon data transfer ways. PJON
- Layered security. Meshwork of gateways.
- Use undiscovered frequencies.
