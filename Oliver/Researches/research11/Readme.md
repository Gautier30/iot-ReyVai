# Environmental Engineering Portfolio: SMEAR Estonia

**Disclaimer:** This text has been written with the help of ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI, and is based on the notes taken during a lecture about environmental engineering, as well as the provided text from the SMEAR Estonia website. Please note that some information may be subject to inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
## Introduction: Cyborg Cockroaches

In the fascinating realm of environmental engineering, researchers are continuously exploring innovative methods to study and understand ecosystems. One such intriguing development involves the use of cyborg cockroaches to gather valuable data on the environment.
## SMEAR: Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations

SMEAR Estonia, part of the Estonian Environmental Observatory, is a research station focused on measuring concentrations and fluxes of energy and matter in the atmosphere-biosphere system. With multiple SMEAR stations in Finland (SMEAR I-IV) and Estonia, this network of research facilities aims to study the complex interplay between different compartments such as atmosphere, forests, lakes, peatlands, and arable land. The dynamic of these systems is mediated by a multitude of biological, chemical, and physical processes acting on multiple scales1.
## Location and Facilities

SMEAR Estonia is established in southeast Estonia at the Järvselja Experimental Forestry station. Additional structures connected to the main station include the "Free Air Humidification Manipulation" (FAHM) experimental site at Rõka (also in Järvselja) and meteorological research at Valgjärve (near Põlva) using a 300 m tower1.
## Data Accessibility

While the data generated by SMEAR is publicly accessible, obtaining it is not as simple as a one-button solution. Efforts to improve data reporting are necessary to facilitate the use of this valuable information.
## Measuring Gases and Aerosols

SMEAR Estonia conducts flux measurements in forests and measures various gases and aerosols. The primary motivation behind these measurements is to understand the CO2-induced climate feedback loop and investigate how forests can filter their own air to create a self-sufficient system.
## Challenges and Limitations

SMEAR Estonia faces several challenges in scaling up its measurement capabilities:

1. High cost of sensors: Due to political reasons, the sensors currently used in SMEAR stations are expensive, limiting the expansion of the system.

2. Weight of sensors: The sensors weigh around 5 kg each, which requires the supporting tower above the forest to be strong enough to handle the load.

3. Infrastructure cost: The cost of the tower and the house under the tower is quite high, amounting to around 200k and 40k, respectively.

In order to address these challenges, SMEAR Estonia needs to explore alternative solutions that can lower costs, reduce sensor weight, and enhance data reporting capabilities.
