## Lecture 10

The guest lecturer showcased his understanding and application of environmental engineering principles, focusing on air pollution and water quality. The lecture, delivered by a Brazilian, emphasized the importance of protecting, preserving, and restoring our natural environment, both indoors and outdoors. We discussed key issues such as air and water pollution, waste management, and real-world case studies from Brazil.

## Case Studies

### Parana Diesel Spill, Brazil
A diesel spill in Parana, Brazil, led to the pollution of the groundwater. To mitigate the impact, monitoring wells were installed to assess the risk to the local biota. The study also examined the time it would take for the pollution to reach the downstream river used by the local population.
Grain Storage Conveyor Belt Air Quality Assessment

### Conveyer belt emissions
Air quality monitoring was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a conveyor belt system for transporting grain from storage facilities to silos. The emission factor was calculated to determine the air quality around the conveyor belt and its impact on the surrounding environment.

## Class Challenge: Air Pollution and IoT
With 91% of the world's population breathing poor-quality air and 1 in 10 dying from air pollution-related diseases, the challenge was to explore the use of IoT for air pollution monitoring in developing countries. The task involved determining what, how, where, and when to monitor air pollution using IoT technology.

## Proposed Solution
We purchased a set of ESP8266 microcontrollers and various air quality sensors (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 sensors) to create a network of monitoring devices. The sensors were strategically placed in a grid-like pattern across the city and in some areas outside the city. Air quality data was collected every half-hour to provide real-time insights into pollution levels. It is all monitored in one central system.

At this point in the lecture I sadly had to leave.
