# Lecture: Telia's IoT, 5G, and Data Insights

Date: May 2, 2023
## Overview

Today's lecture was given by a representative from Telia, a leading telecommunications company. The talk focused on the development and implementation of 5G, IoT, and data insights, as well as the transition from older generations of mobile networks.
## Key Points

Telia's Network Evolution:
- Telia is actively working on the development and implementation of 5G.
- The company is shutting down 3G and keeping 2G operational for now, while 1G was shut down long ago.
- 4G remains the bread and butter of Telia's network infrastructure.

NB-IoT and LTE-M:
- Telia prefers NB-IoT devices due to their excellent battery life.
- Scooters and bikes typically use LTE-M.
- NB-IoT is expected to replace 2G and 3G networks in the future.

IoT Water Meters:
- Tallinn's water utility plans to replace existing water meters with IoT water meters that utilize NB-IoT technology.
- These meters are only used for broadcasting, and will wait to send a packet if the connection is poor.
- They also have built-in logic to detect water leaks.

Crowd Insight and Data Valuation:
- Telia can monitor crowd insights to determine how many people are in a specific location.
- Although Telia claims to be in the digitalization business, the lecturer suggested they are more involved in data valuation.
- The company's key focuses include M2M, IoT, and Data Insights.

IoT Use Cases:
- Bolt: A popular transportation service utilizing IoT.
- ELMO: A relocation service that remotely controls cars.
- Tehnopol and MÖMesi: Collaborated to build smart beehives, smart pedestrian crossings, smart shops, smart road line drawing machines, and scooter charging stations.
- Krakul OÜ: Developed smart shoe soles for professional athletes to prevent injuries.

## Reflection

Quote: "Without data, you are just another person with an opinion!"

This quote emphasizes the importance of data in making informed decisions and supporting one's arguments. While opinions are valuable, they become more powerful when supported by accurate and relevant data. Data-driven insights provide a strong foundation for decision-making, strategy development, and the validation of new ideas. In the context of Telia's work, data is crucial for understanding customer needs, optimizing network performance, and developing innovative IoT solutions.

Lecturer is from Telia.
Telia is developing 5G, shutting down 3G and keeping 2G for now, 1G was shut down long ago. 4G is the bread and butter. Telia prefers NB-IoT devices since it has good battery life. Scooters, bikes use LTE-M. NB-IoT will probably replace 2G and 3G. Tallinn water utility will replace water meters with IoT watermeters that use NB-IoT. The watermeters are only broadcasting, If the connection is bad the watermeter wait to send the packet. They have logic for water leaks. Telia can monitor crowd insight, on how many people are in a specific location. Telia says that they are in the digitalization business, but the lecturer says they are more in the Data valuation business -M2M -IoT -Data insight. Example use cases of IoT: Bolt. ELMO relocation of cars by remote control cars. Tehnopol and MÖMesi build smart beehives, smart pedestrian crossings, smart shop, smart road line drawing machines, scooter charging station. Krakul OÜ do smart shoe soles for professional athletes to prevent injuries. Add an answer to the following quote: "Without data you are just another person with an opinion!" Is it so, why and why not?
