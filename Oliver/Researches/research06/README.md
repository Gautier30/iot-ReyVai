# Scaling up!

## What will be issues scaling up (system size, number of systems, management)?

- It is impossible to create a "perfect" system.
- Adding different types of devices/systems (Covered by IoTempower)
- No standard practice for scaling (Covered by IoTempower)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Power management and battery life concerns
- Connectivity and network infrastructure issues (Covered by IoTempower)
- Reuse old tech/create new
## How can we do testing?

- Testing by prototyping (Covered by IoTempower)
- Testing by integration (Covered by IoTempower)
- Testing by simulation (Covered by IoTempower)
- Creating stories
- Idustrial controllers
## What would you like to see for scaling up? (What is not so great currently?)

- Setting up real devices, sensors takes time (Kinda covered by IoTempower)
- Coding is a huge headache
- Best practices for scaling (Covered by IoTempower)
- Common problems are absent
## What role will play simulator(-component)s, MQTT, and stories?

- Simulations help get a better picture of issues that might rise (Covered by IoTempower)
- MQTT helps quick prototyping (Covered by IoTempower)

## This is what we came up with collectively as a class:

More devices are needed.
More human input is needed.
Number of systems depends on business architecture.
System management could be central, but depends on system architecture.
System needs to be secured, more devices mean more security risk, thus more security solutions.
Human factor is also a risk factor, technology could be secured, but the humans could be risk factor.
How to secure your devices against vandalism and natural teardown.
Get long distance coverage and how to run the infrastructure. 
Should we reuse old or create new tech
Testing, taking all the real world conditions into account
How to provide energy and internet to sensors and microcontrollers in a large scale size
How do we deal with the bandwidth factor when the scale of the network is giant. 
Server load balancing
Planning in general
Higher cost of upkeep for servers/sensors 
Hardware management and maintenance, especially in dangerous conditions
Networking, how to handle the gateway failing and how to talk to handle communication between subnets
Power management
Sensors drift over time, how to ensure replacement.


How can we do testing?
We will do laboratory model.
Start in the lab and then go to the field
Different levels of the tests, all could be tested.
Industrial controllers. 
Measure network usage and various other metrics
Emulation and Simulation.
Load Testing.
Test in close to real world conditions if possible
Differences in lab in field




What would you like to see for scaling up? (What is not so great currently?)
Lora support. Mobile network support. Long distance radio network. Starlink. 
Need for one all-incorporating communication protocol. Currently lots of different standards for communication protocols. Protocol standardization
Some meshwork of drones gateways that fly and collect data from nodes.
Over the air updates and deploying. 




What role will simulator(-component)s, MQTT, and stories play?
To find customers, to convince them, the story is important still.
Story needs to contain key components of the system.
Simulator is the sales tool as well.
MQTT just confusion word, to make system to seem complicated and expensive, to get high price tag.
To determine exactly how the components will/should be used and how they will react/respond in different scenarios/environments
