 - What does the Internet of Things entail?

>IoT is a network of physical devices that enables the devices to exchange data. IoT devices and network vary in complexity; they can be really simple and really complex. Main goal of IoT is to automate everyday objects. IoT requires hardware (sensors, microcontroller, etc) and software that makes sense of the data.

 Use a laptop to google IoT, find and note down including small descriptions in ten minutes and compare with neighbours.
 - 3 domains
 - 2 commonly used (data) protocols
 - 2 typical devices

Extend your domain and appliance/devices list; by each two you
didnâ€™t have yet by watching the like a bosch video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2kV6pgJxuo

Watch the TIA IoT Introduction https://youtu.be/jJaWMWz6RpE?t=145 until 16:11

- Add four benefits of IoT (1 from the first video and one from the second).
- What are the challenges? (record at least 3)
- What else is noteworthy? (record if something stands out for you)
