 - What does the Internet of Things entail?



 Use laptop to google about IoT, find and note down including small description in ten minutes time and compare with neighbor.
 - 3 domains
 - 2 commonly used (data) protocols
 - 2 typical devices

Extend your domain and appliance/devices list, by each 2 you
didnâ€™t have yet by watching the like a bosch video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2kV6pgJxuo

Watch the TIA IoT Introduction https://youtu.be/jJaWMWz6RpE?t=145 until 16:11
