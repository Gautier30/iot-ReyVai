## Reflection lecture

The lecture was good but the portfolio tasks were not so good. The portfolio tasks seemed somehow different this week. The videos covered too much and too briefly. The overview about Dataflow pipeline, Stream procssing and Process engine were good. The difference between dataflow pipeline and process engine was not so clear since they had alot of similarities. The tool names didn't seem that important since they went in from one ear and came out the other, maybe something stuck aswell. Still a really good lecture, I am just good at pointing out the specific stuff I didn't like.

## Reflection lab

We decided to use the Node-RED in one computer only since the application throws annoying error messages on the screen every time you try to merge a branch. We had some difficulty getting the flow working and we used a python script to publish temperatures for the "ac unit". We got the discord bot task started by the end of the lab.
