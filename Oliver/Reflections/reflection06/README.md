## Lecture reflection

In this lecture We discussed scaling up IoT systems. I learned about cool projects other students are working on.

## Lab reflection

In the lab we finished only first 2 tasks and we completed the rest outside lab hours. I did the Text receiver and RFID scanner buttons by myself.
