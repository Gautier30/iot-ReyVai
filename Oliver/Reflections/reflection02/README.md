In the first lab we explored the kit provided by supervisors and identified the parts inside. We also checked if all the right parts were given to us. A GitHub repository was set up for our portfolios and we formed pairs. I became apart of a pair of three. Since I had already seen the kit I was not suprised by it's components. My teammates could usually identify the use of the parts just by looking at them but I had to do some extra research.

My knowledge about the more technical stuff is lacking as I don't know what all the pins are usually used for and I could not identify the buses. I guess this kind of knowledge comes with time.

I was able to learn some basic stuff about the different buses from my teammates and the indtructors were also helpful.
