## Lecture reflection

In this lecture we learned more about Node-RED and condsidered the benefits of using IoTempire. I am starting to finally understand how IoTempire works and why it is useful. I will try to use it when doing my thesis.

## Lab reflection

I felt this lab went well since I was now more familiar with IoTempire and felt like I knew what I was doing. We got all the nodes working seperately but did not manage to connect them as one big system.
