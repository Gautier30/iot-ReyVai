# Observant participant diary in the Internet of Things course - Spring 2023


Portfolio
Each person in the group should have branch. 


##  Week 1
I was not present in the first week unfortunately. 

##  Week 2

Portfolios. I personally had a hard time understanding how the portfolios should be done. I was really lost, and the classroom time was so fast passed that I was overwhelmed by it all. I believe it is really important to have a **whole lecture(class)** or even 2 to explain and show examples of good portfolios of the past. Explain the importance of it and make it clear of what is expected of the students. Talked to some other students that actually felt the same. Especially those who joined the class latter.

The lab to set up the Github is nice practical side of this assignment but should be there to compliment the lecture on it.


### Lecture reflection
Story driven modelling was introduced, but we did not practice after. I believe we should only get introduced to a method if we are about to work with it in that class, especially when we were asked to research Challenge Based Education right after. I also strong believed that a **whole lecture** should be dedicated to this method showing good examples(more than one), which was done, but quickly. And then students should get to practice multiple times on this on the next lab. 

I was getting acquainted with the participatory style of the lectures so I was lost and a bit over whelmed with the paste of the class.

When it was time for Group research about the Buses Protocols i became really lost. I did not have my discord set up yet and could not find any of the links for the slides.

I also believe that 10 min is a really short time for doing a research on a topic, write down your findings, discuss with your group and organize them in a presentation. For me it there was very little time to deepen on any of those activities, especially for newcomers as we had to find the slides, join Discord, edit it, discuss with the group who would research what and prepare a little presentation.

I also perceived that my group was so rushing to get the presentation up and running that we did not have any time to discuss anything between ourselves. Each student was just fully concentrated in his/her own computer, making it a kind of useless to be in a group. I enjoy very much the participatory approach to lecturing and I truly believe in this style of education, but I do not believe in the fast past, somewhat stressful situation. I suggest that groups need more open time for discussions, interactions and for deepening in the topics proposed. 

In my case, I am still unfamiliar with the low level buses protocols in general, So I suggest that a more detailed introduction about the topic of low level protocol and how they are used in the context of the Internet of Things and then demand students to do research about the specific protocols, but give them a little more time as to prepare and discuss with the group.

I also felt that a lot of information is presented in one lecture. 

### Lab reflection
My lab was also a disaster in a sense that I hadn't had anything setup on my machine yet. So I spent most of Lab time getting Git set up and twicking with the Manjaro's settings to be able to flash the D1 mini with Serial
Thankfully I got help from my group mate Gautier, the TA and also the Prof. Ulrich. 
Besides those setting up challenges, getting the LED to blink and some variations was quite easy as I have done it before.

### Helping team mates
Towards the end, I was able to interplay with my pair and actually was able to help him the the button to light up the LED to work. He was not using a *pull-down* resistor on the push button so a noise signal was coming through making the LED to be constantly lit. So I inserted the resistor in place and the set up worked. 



## Week 3

### Lecture
Today the times given to the groups was much better. They seemed enough. It is better to write down the diagram by hand than trying to design them on the computer.
I also realized that all student that sign up after the first week of class have a real hard time catching up and understanding the course's dynamics. I believe this is due to the highly condensed and fast paste aspect of the IoT course.

Its interesting to break down the lecture into Live lecturing and videos. I brings a different dynamic to the lecture. I find it valuable to watch the video in class and discuss it with everyone right after, but also having access to the video later to watch it at home. It helps me study better this way instead of just having a long lecture or a recording of a long lecture. 

### lab 3
Loved the phone tethering solution for the providing internet to the PI while functioning as an access point. I think this is the best solution to be completed independent of outside infrastructure.

There was definitely not enough time to do all the activities proposed.
    In classroom time we managed to set up the RaspberryPi by installing the image and also setting it up as an access point after some trials.
    We also manged to start the draft for our scenario. I really enjoyed this brainstorming story ideas and believe it is a great approach to project based education. 

All the Actors and Sensors via WebRequest had to done after the class time. We spent another 2 extra hours making those nodes work. There was another group that stayed longer than us in the classroom.

OBS: I believe that this lab needs to be split in 2 or the scenario part must be done in a different lab or time. 


I started searching for a research strategy to help me be a participant observer in the IoT class this Spring. I started making contact with some anthropologists. I am also planning to team up with Franaz and Matevz to help put together a survey to collect some data from the students. 

## Week 4

I found that posting to Discord made things a bit confusing to read and discuss.
The video played in fastspeed not so good. 

Share the finds verbally with group was better and faster.


Video can start on the action already.
