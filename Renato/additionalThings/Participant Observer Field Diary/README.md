# Observant participant diary in the Internet of Things course - Spring 2023


Portfolio
Each person in the group should have branch. 


##  Week 1
I was not present in the first week unfortunately. 

##  Week 2

Portfolios. I personally had a hard time understanding how the portfolios should be done. I was really lost, and the classroom time was so fast passed that I was overwhelmed by it all. I believe it is really important to have a **whole lecture(class)** or even 2 to explain and show examples of good portfolios of the past. Explain the importance of it and make it clear of what is expected of the students. Talked to some other students that actually felt the same. Especially those who joined the class latter.

Maybe a part of the more pragmatic part of the portfolio can be done in an automated form (google form?) format to help grading latter. 

The lab to set up the Github is nice practical side of this assignment but should be there to compliment the lecture on it.


### Lecture reflection
Story driven modelling was introduced, but we did not practice after. I believe we should only get introduced to a method if we are about to work with it in that class, especially when we were asked to research Challenge Based Education right after. I also strong believed that a **whole lecture** should be dedicated to this method showing good examples(more than one), which was done, but quickly. And then students should get to practice multiple times on this on the next lab. 

I was getting acquainted with the participatory style of the lectures so I was lost and a bit over whelmed with the paste of the class.

When it was time for Group research about the Buses Protocols i became really lost. I did not have my discord set up yet and could not find any of the links for the slides.

I also believe that 10 min is a really short time for doing a research on a topic, write down your findings, discuss with your group and organize them in a presentation. For me it there was very little time to deepen on any of those activities, especially for newcomers as we had to find the slides, join Discord, edit it, discuss with the group who would research what and prepare a little presentation.

I also perceived that my group was so rushing to get the presentation up and running that we did not have any time to discuss anything between ourselves. Each student was just fully concentrated in his/her own computer, making it a kind of useless to be in a group. I enjoy very much the participatory approach to lecturing and I truly believe in this style of education, but I do not believe in the fast past, somewhat stressful situation. I suggest that groups need more open time for discussions, interactions and for deepening in the topics proposed. 

In my case, I am still unfamiliar with the low level buses protocols in general, So I suggest that a more detailed introduction about the topic of low level protocol and how they are used in the context of the Internet of Things and then demand students to do research about the specific protocols, but give them a little more time as to prepare and discuss with the group.

I also felt that a lot of information is presented in one lecture. 

### Lab reflection
My lab was also a disaster in a sense that I hadn't had anything setup on my machine yet. So I spent most of Lab time getting Git set up and twicking with the Manjaro's settings to be able to flash the D1 mini with Serial
Thankfully I got help from my group mate Gautier, the TA and also the Prof. Ulrich. 
Besides those setting up challenges, getting the LED to blink and some variations was quite easy as I have done it before.

### Helping team mates
Towards the end, I was able to interplay with my pair and actually was able to help him the the button to light up the LED to work. He was not using a *pull-down* resistor on the push button so a noise signal was coming through making the LED to be constantly lit. So I inserted the resistor in place and the set up worked. 



## Week 3

### Lecture
Today the times given to the groups was much better. They seemed enough. It is better to write down the diagram by hand than trying to design them on the computer.
I also realized that all student that sign up after the first week of class have a real hard time catching up and understanding the course's dynamics. I believe this is due to the highly condensed and fast paste aspect of the IoT course.

Its interesting to break down the lecture into Live lecturing and videos. I brings a different dynamic to the lecture. I find it valuable to watch the video in class and discuss it with everyone right after, but also having access to the video later to watch it at home. It helps me study better this way instead of just having a long lecture or a recording of a long lecture. 

### lab 3
Loved the phone tethering solution for the providing internet to the PI while functioning as an access point. I think this is the best solution to be completed independent of outside infrastructure.

There was definitely not enough time to do all the activities proposed.
    In classroom time we managed to set up the RaspberryPi by installing the image and also setting it up as an access point after some trials.
    We also manged to start the draft for our scenario. I really enjoyed this brainstorming story ideas and believe it is a great approach to project based education. 

All the Actors and Sensors via WebRequest had to done after the class time. We spent another 2 extra hours making those nodes work. There was another group that stayed longer than us in the classroom.

OBS: I believe that this lab needs to be split in 2 or the scenario part must be done in a different lab or time. 


I started searching for a research strategy to help me be a participant observer in the IoT class this Spring. I started making contact with some anthropologists. I am also planning to team up with Franaz and Matevz to help put together a survey to collect some data from the students. 

## Week 4

I found that posting to Discord made things a bit confusing to read and discuss.
The video played in fast speed was not such a good idea. 

Share the finds verbally with group was better and faster.


Video can start on the action already.

Discussing with Matevz today I realized that the portfolio is a pedagogical tool to better students habits on documentation. Documenting their work through git and markup is way for them to get used to this part of programming. 

## Week 5

I believe the demonstration of the Node-red in the class was very important. It brings some understanding and a practical example of the application. It was still fast pasted though. I have been discussing with prof. Ulrich about this fast past and the amount of material he tries to fit in every meeting. Especially in the lab. 

I see that every group only gets about half way into the exercises and most of it left to be done at home. Home is not a problem, but the trouble I see is that the more complex exercises are left for home. In my group I see that we do not always have time to meet outside of class, and for this reason, only one person ends up finishing the exercises of the Lab. 

Last thing that strikes me is that we do not usually have time in the next lecture to bring our doubts and problems from the week before. And somethings get unresolved which to me creates this limbo since the subject relay on on building up from previous week's learning. 

In the positive end, I believe the gateway Raspberry Pi is a strong tool that encourage group work. How every group can manage their own network is innovative solution for the teaching of IoT. It centers the teaching around the network infrastructure (mini). I also believe that for the students to take the network home is also a breakthrough. 

### In this sense the IoTgateway functions as a **design thing** and also a Provotype sometimes. 


For example, I found it really frustrating to have merge conflicts in Node-Red with my Group mates, but that enforced us to come up with a solution to work together, which again, I wished we had more time to do it. 

In my point of view, we could used the entire Lab for a few exercises only. The discord connection was the most relevant to me at this one lab. It would be enough to do that and maybe build on that to create creative nodes interaction.

## Week 6

It was relevant to think critically about scaling and what the challenges could be. I also believe that these discussions are getting more adapt time wise. But this discussion took too much class time that could have been used to Introduce IoTempire Framework better or maybe even introduce another framework. 

There is no need to over justify why we are using IoTempire in the class unless the students question it.

I was not sure if sharing the results in a DOC is more effective than just discussing about it only. (maybe something to be tested here)

LAB

I noticed that in the LAB things are hepatic and chaotic because we are dealing with many layers of activities at the same time. 

This specific lab was about trying out IoTempower so it should focus (and only) on that: 

- How to use cloud commander;
- how to setup a first node;
- How to adopt a node properly;
- How to create a new file for a topic; 
- How to find the examples;

And than build on top of that. Use the button node to send an audio alert, etc. 

***OBS***: The ESP 32 set up with DHT22 made no sense to be in this lab. It had no apparent connection with learning how to use the FrameWork. It took valuable time form the Lab and it was not working. This does not mean it should not be introduced at some point, but just in a different lab.

Maybe have lab devoted for other alternative board besides the D1 mini. 

There was no time for the RFID. I still think that the precious class time should be used for the hardest tasks. They usually spill over for home where we have no support. 

It would be good to use a part of the next lecture to help with the issues from the spilled over tasks.


## Week 7

I participated on the lecture online via Zoom because I was sick. I seemed like the lecture flowed well in the online format because Prof. Ulrich did lecture more and did demonstration. In his regard, he believed that we needed to have less lecturing and more interactions. For me the flow of the class was great, I am not sure if in the physical class, this was felt differently.The choice of been able to part take in the class online if needed is very useful so we don't have to miss class in the case of sickness or travel. I believe that teaching strategies have changed from the pandemic experience. 

LAB

I must point out that on the lab this week, the way all 3 members of my team could be accessing the same gateway and work on the same time (flashing cannot be done at the same time).

The documentation was outdated and we where having problems initializing a simple relay node.

Gautier was saying that he does not like how everything is hidden and he did not do everything from scratch. So when these things happen, we are just stuck. If he wrote most of the code, he can debug it easier.


## Week 8

The idea of bringing a guest lecture to present a tool that is a direct "competitive" to the tool we are using in class form the framework, in this case Grafana vs. Node-red, brought some interesting dynamics to the lecture. Time was not managed to make a fair comparison though and also to do a more profound discussion about how these each tool is more appropriate for each situation. It was still really rich experience to see the differences and similarities with both tools. 

LAB

The lab today was going really well. We were combining the single RGB_LED with the relay lock and RFID part into the same project. 

We got the lock-door project working, but when we tried to improve the timing on the lock, bugs started happening. The relay node was rebooting after all the time. The RFID stopped working, it would only read sometimes the ID. 
Another group was also having the same trouble with the Relay node crashing often.


That would be really important for the libraries to be tested and functional before we work with them in the classroom.

**Talking to Ulno, we imagined that it would be important to have a test network setup and running all the time where we could test every update and see what breaks. Have it running on a server with dashboards and debug messages that can show when nodes crash and why they crashed.**

Also it would again be important to have snapshots of the framework of more stable versions of most libraries.

Ulno said that a whole stable version is an utopian idea, but a somewhat stable version is doable I believe. 

## Week 9

The class had shorter slides. Only the next project presentation and the LED strip demonstration with some discussions. It was a very fluent class. Making us take fewer notes and have discussing about the demonstration and videos made the class feel natural timing.

The only thing in my view is that LED demos should have been done first and than next lab project presented. I mean changed the order.

I also wish that lectures and labs would not be separated. Class could just have topics presented and than pratical work on the same day. For example, I would have loved it if we worked have tested the LED stirp after the demo in the class. For this, maybe "lecture" days could be longer. 4h. Then labs would only be used for the bigger projects. 

## Week 10

It was interesting that what the discussion we had about the final project presentation was taken into account. Postar style presentation was a clever idea for the final project days.


This idea to invovle normal people in the collection of data. Have a little station or network for collection data. 


Tradescantia clone - Bio sensoring. Plant mutation. More in the winter time. 

## Week 11

Stefen 's presented the SMEAR station. Bringing in some guest lectures is really good to expand the horizon of the students with real life application. Some talk was done in the direction of how can students help the scientist with their problems, but not much concrete opportunities was presented to them to do so. I had the chance to go visit the station myself after the class. It was a very valeuable visit. We would be good to create more solid oportunities for these exchanges to happen. Use one of the challenges from the SMEAR project to be one of the classroom challenge. Or create some kind of internship for some students to go work with the TEAM from the STATION and help them solve problems as their final project.  Or maybe create teams with the MCU students to work in collaboration in one of their problems. 

For me, I was thinking that IoTempower with the kit can became a good citizen science station if we can improve usability and stability. And this can be something to we could actually contribute to the Enviromental Engineering, and also a way to augment the reach of the network and create community. They way that Emilio explained how they did data collection with students in Curitiba was so rudimentary, which makes me believe that we do not need to account for so many features on our Framework to make this collaboration possible. 
We just need to find ways for them to use it, make it possible for them to use it easily and reliably. **This is also some field work that I could do for my PhD**. 


LAB

Since the guest lecture took all the time that was assigned to the Projects presentation, I thought it was a smart strategy to make Groups actually pitch to each other their final project ideas, and have the TAs and Professor walk around and talk to all Groups instead of each group presenting in front of the whole class. This was we could do presentations and also have time left to work on our projects within the 2h Lab session.

Maybe suggest that group members should sometimes take 5 min break and go see what other groups are doing so eventually everyone has an understanding of their classmate projects.


## Week 12

The class today had a really good interaction. This fluid model finding issues on our own, than sharing them with a pair and eventually discussing it with the whole class worked quite well. 

Students gave their insights of what is or can be broken in the Framework and what is a security weakness. Then they shared possible solutions and feature implementations that could mitigate these issues. Students gave valuable insight for improvements and Ulrich gave hints that these could be good Bachelor's and Masters thesis in a attempt to get some students to contribute to the framework. I believe this is a good start to try to build a more active community, though I think other strategies need to be implemented to effectively get students to join and take on these implementations for their thesis. Maybe there can be some reward for them or they can take in one of these challenges in the place of the final project (and that would be a start towards their thesis already).



### Hardening in Practice

● What fixes could we implement in IoTempower (and our setups)?

Very secure internet connection via gate with firewalls and the latest encryption. 
Raise awareness.
Meshwork of gateways - batman. 
Encrypt communication inside the local network. From device to device. Node to node.

- Close all the outside ports and harden the SSH port with a public Key; 
- Prompt to change a default password on first login (good bachelors' thesis);
- Implement biometrics authentication for the framework (master thesis);
- Make the local network exclusive with symmetric encryption or 2 factors authorization;
- Use VPN or wire guard on the devices;
- Use SSL (TLS) on the ESP32. but not optimal for ESP 8266. Maybe run a local central authority on the gateway (PI);
- Have documentation for all the ports and provide links of how to harden them;
- White list the devices, use trusted elements and maybe a remote wipe function; 
- Use the newest standards, WPA3. (Not supported on the Raspberry Pi Access Point); 
- Implement PJON one wire communication for different wireless communication. 
- Implement some kind of mesh security levels into the architecture. Many different type of network architecture for different proposes varying the risk factors. More levels of security through zoning.
