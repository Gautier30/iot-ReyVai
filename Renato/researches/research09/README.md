Can saw leds in clothes.



A great scenario is to create a simple low pix screen and display your data with different animations.

So many interface possib

### LED and animation in IoTempower

***pros and cons***

CONS:

Current and volt limiting. Power supply is a challenge when you run too many LEDS. 

Dealing with bigger matrixes would be supper finicky with these set up cause we need many microntrolers. 
Scalling hard power managment

Not being able to control more than one strip per wemos d1mini. We can only use one port for the bus.

cool scenarios with led lights

We can make a low pix video game or;
Motocicle jacket or helmet with brake and turn signals. 
getho 

Cross walk signals. The ground can glow in animations when someone is crossing. 


What are technical challenges - what can go wrong?
