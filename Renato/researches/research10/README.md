Removing pollution from the soil.
Measure concentration of poluents on the ground water. 

IoT antena for for airpolution 
(SDS011 + Raspberry) to calculate Particulate Matter 

PM 2.5 particles.

### AIR POLLUTION CHALLENGE

Air Pollution in Curitiba
What will you monitor?

DHT11 Temperature and Humidity
CO2 Sensor
OZONE Sensor
PM2.5 Air Quality Sensor
Dust collector device
Ananometer
Optical sensors
MQ sensor

Combining data with Satelite data. 


One downtown, one in the suburbs, one in the Industrial area, one where there are the most automobile flux.


"Pollutants tied to human and environmental health impacts include PM2.5, PM10, ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. The greater the density of pollutants in the air, the higher the Air Quality Index (AQI), a scale that runs from zero to 500. An AQI of 50 or below is considered safe, while readings above 100 are deemed unhealthy. According to UNEP partner IQAir, only 38 of 117 countries and regions averaged healthy AQI readings in 2021."

Some use lasers to scan particulate matter density in a cubic metre of air, while others rely on satellite imaging to measure energy reflected or emitted by the Earth.

Wire the sensor up to a Raspberry gateway which is connected to GSM 3G network and send the data to the LAB. Hourly data.
