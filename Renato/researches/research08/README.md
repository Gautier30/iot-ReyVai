## Lecture slides


## Grafana presentation

Used to monitor infrastructure

Used for visiualization of data. 
Open source.

Dashboards for databases.

Time based database has a timestamp attached.
Realtime database.
Plugin for databasees.
ex: Prometeus, influxdb, graphite, openTSDB


Component:
Dashboards

Data Sources

Alerts and notifications
Mqtt possible
Email and Slack notifications
Smtp


Data can be pulled or pushed

Example: paho.mqtt


Plugin that help us with 3D visualization

## Node-red

Capacity analog sensor.
Too many values. Need to implement filters.
Use the node Delay for filters in node red.

Limit on the device using the .pollrate(10) or
mean

fluent interface - chain

We can use influxDB with node-red also. use the inject node. 

Node red makes it easy to create interactive interaction.

But Grafana is more refined in the data visualization and customization.
