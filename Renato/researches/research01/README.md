## Who are U?
I am Renato,
I am an artist from Brazil and just started my PhD studies at the University of Tartu in Computer Science. 
My research revolves around the artist creative process to aid with IoT education.
I have little experience programing. Mostly JavaScript and Web dev. 
A bit o C++ and Arduino. A bit of Python. 
I also have made some art using Processing. 
I have done interactive art and IoT with micro controllers. I am acquainted with ESP 2866 and ESP 32 and Arduino. 
I have used the single-board computers RaspberryPI, Atomic Pi and the Udoo Quad.

## What is IoT ?
The Internet of Things is the concept that relates to the connection of devices with sensors and actuators that collect and share their data through some kind of network.  
 **Domains of application:** smart homes, self-driven cars, fitness wearables, smart cities, logistics science data collection.
 **Some used protocols:** MQTT, HTTP (Rest APIs), Zigbee.
**Some used Devices:** ESP8266, ESP32 Âµ-controller, arduino, smart watches, smart lamps, voice assistants.

### #LikeABosch comercial

The LikeABosch video shows a lifestyle where most of the day to day objects are connected and sharing data. From the car to the fridge.

### TIA IoT

The 2 IoT domains that are most commons are healthcare and agriculture.
IoT could be highly beneficial to the world as it permits devices that can support embedded systems to communicate with each other and also exchange data and services. It is one of backbones for the Industry 4.0. It also allows remote access to data and resources.
The biggest challenges that IoT faces are related to security, power consumption and infrastructure for it to be implemented on a massive scale as it is intended.
