# Reflections

## week 3
Today the times given to the groups was much better. They seemed enough. It is better to write down the diagram by hand than trying to design them on the computer.
I also realized that all student that sign up after the first week of class have a real hard time catching up and understanding the course's dynamics. I believe this is due to the highly condensed and fast paste aspect of the IoT course.

Its interesting to break down the lecture into Live lecturing and videos. I brings a different dynamic to the lecture. I find it valuable to watch the video in class and discuss it with everyone right after, but also having access to the video later to watch it at home. It helps me study better this way instead of just having a long lecture or a recording of a long lecture. 


## lab 3
Loved the phone tethering solution for the providing internet to the PI while functioning as an access point. I think this is the best solution to be completed independent of outside infrastructure.

There was definitely not enough time to do all the activities proposed.
    In classroom time we managed to set up the RaspberryPi by installing the image and also setting it up as an access point after some trials.
    We also manged to start the draft for our scenario. I really enjoyed this brainstorming story ideas and believe it is a great approach to project based education. 

All the Actors and Sensors via WebRequest had to done after the class time. We spent another 2 extra hours making those nodes work. There was another group that stayed longer than us in the classroom.

OBS: I believe that this lab needs to be split in 2 or the scenario part must be done in a different lab or time.
