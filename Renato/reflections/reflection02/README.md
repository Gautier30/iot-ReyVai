# Reflections

## week 2

## Lecture reflection
Story driven modelling was introduced, but we did not practice after. I believe we should only get introduced to a method if we are about to work with it in that class, especially when we were asked to research Challenge Based Education right after. 

I was getting acquainted with the participatory style of the lectures so I was lost and a bit over whelmed with the past of the class.

When it was time for Group research about the Buses Protocols i became really lost. I did not have my discord set up yet and could not find any of the links for the slides.

I also believe that 10 min is a really short time for doing a research on a topic, write down your findings, discuss with your group and organize them in a presentation. For me it there was very little time to deepen on any of those activities, especially for newcomers as we had to find the slides, join Discord, edit it, discuss with the group who would research what and prepare a little presentation.

I also perceived that my group was so rushing to get the presentation up and running that we did not have any time to discuss anything between ourselves. Each student was just fully concentrated in his/her own computer, making it a kind of useless to be in a group. I enjoy very much the participatory approach to lecturing and I truly believe in this style of education, but I do not believe in the fast past, somewhat stressful situation. I suggest that groups need more open time for discussions, interactions and for deepening in the topics proposed. 

In my case, I am still unfamiliar with the low level buses protocols in general, So I suggest that a more detailed introduction about the topic of low level protocol and how they are used in the context of the Internet of Things and then demand students to do research about the specific protocols, but give them a little more time as to prepare and discuss with the group.

I also felt that a lot of information is presented in one lecture. 

## Lab reflection
My lab was also a disaster in a sense that I hadn't had anything setup on my machine yet. So I spent most of Lab time getting Git set up and twicking with the Manjaro's settings to be able to flash the D1 mini with Serial
Thankfully I got help from my group mate Gautier, the TA and also the Prof. Ulrich. 
Besides those setting up challenges, getting the LED to blink and some variations was quite easy as I have done it before.

### Helping team mates
Towards the end, I was able to interplay with my pair and actually was able to help him the the button to light up the LED to work. He was not using a *pull-down* resistor on the push button so a noise signal was coming through making the LED to be constantly lit. So I inserted the resistor in place and the set up worked.
