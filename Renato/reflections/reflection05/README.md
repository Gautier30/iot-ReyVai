# Reflections

## week 5
I really like that the Lecture was a demonstration of the Node-red. It was still fast pasted. It was enjoyable to get a hands-on introduction of Node-Red in the lecture. I think the chaos and trouble happened when we were not able to manage the merges and multi users in the same Node-Red. I wish there was more help with that. 
Instead of just having a discussion about simulators, we could have work on some troubles that groups had in the practical exercises from the last lab, maybe?

## lab 5


The exercises were very interesting and Node-Red is a great tool for integration. It was hard to manage many people working on the same Node-Red and we did not come up with a good solution yet for it. 
I am also running into trouble with Git and merging the files we are working on together. I keep having to do a fetch and merge quite often on the Lab pair files. I believe its because I take a while to update my portfolio and sometimes I keep my files for a long period.
