# Reflections

## Week 7

I participated on the lecture online via Zoom because I was sick. I seemed like the lecture flowed well in the online format because Prof. Ulrich did lecture more and did demonstration. In his regard, he believed that we needed to have less lecturing and more interactions. For me the flow of the class was great, I am not sure if in the physical class, this was felt differently.The choice of been able to part take in the class online if needed is very useful so we don't have to miss class in the case of sickness or travel. I believe that teaching strategies have changed from the pandemic experience. 

LAB

I must point out that on the lab this week, the way all 3 members of my team could be accessing the same gateway and work on the same time (flashing cannot be done at the same time).

The documentation was outdated and we where having problems initializing a simple relay node.

Gautier was saying that he does not like how everything is hidden and he did not do everything from scratch. So when these things happen, we are just stuck. If he wrote most of the code, he can debug it easier.
