## Lab 8

The lab today was going really well. We were combining the single RGB_LED with the relay lock and RFID part into the same project. 

We got the lock-door project working, but when we tried to improve the timing on the lock, bugs started happening. The relay node was rebooting after all the time. The RFID stopped working, it would only read sometimes the ID. 

We are not sure yet what is happening with the code.
