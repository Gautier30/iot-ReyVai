## Problems

We didn't comment out the WIFI SSD first so not WIFI yet.

We did not want to use our EDUROAM password so we took the Thetaring rout

Forwarding the internet to the personal computer was not routing form the PI. We tried to reboot it, but no problem.

I can not have any WIFI-IN configured when using thetharing

Thetharing is the easiest way to get internet.
