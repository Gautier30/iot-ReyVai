Olinato Reyvai loves to eat fresh salad, but he just moved to Tartu, Estonia in the winter and is having vitamin withdrawals. He needs to eat more fresh greens and he found that the salads that can be bought at supermarkets come from foreign countries and are not fresh enough.

He is newbie gardener, but he is willing to try out some ideas he found on the internet. 
He started brainstorming some ideas. He lives on the sixth floor and facing the sun rise. He thinks he can grow some micro-green with the sunlight from his window. 
He is not sure, he might need complement the light with an LED grown lights. 
He wants to grown enough salad for himself eventually just on the balcony of his window with window planter box.

- Measure the hight of the plants from the light;
- Measure PH from water;
- He needs to control a water pump for auto watering;
- Measure Ar humidity;
