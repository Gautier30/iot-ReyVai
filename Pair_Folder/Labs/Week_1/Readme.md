### The Git repository

This week's lab was all about building the pair repo with Oliver to store our work and portfolios. We basically teamed up because we were sitting next to each other in the classroom. He has some experience with IoT, and so do I, it should be a good match. Steven also joined us temporarily, until his actual pairmate shows up.

About the team for the final project, I'd rather not rush things. I know from experience I need to know the people I work with. A group project is a serious commitment and far too often was I let down.

### The Kit

We were given our IoT kit and had to make sure all the parts were there. A checklist is available at this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fLWOfnRmRYBiHimDT01P7l9Acyzl0UH3qg7LzRfT2fk/edit?usp=sharing
We also tried to search for the buses of some of the components, but it wasn't always trivial.
